# matrix

This module is a part of [yirong-c/CLRS](https://github.com/yirong-c/CLRS)

This is a matrix library that supports operator overloading and Strassen's algorithm.

## Note

UniqueMatrix object contains data of matrix.

SharedMatrix object is generated by UniqueMatrix object.
SharedMatrix object has access to data of UniqueMatrix object.
The offset index (base index) of Matrix can be specified by 
generating a SharedMatrix object.

If the UniqueMatrix object is destroyed,
all SharedMatrix objects generated by the UniqueMatrix object
will be invalid.
